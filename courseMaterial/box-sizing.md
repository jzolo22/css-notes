## Box Sizing

- `content-box` is the default setting
  - takes into account ONLY the content when height and width are calculated
  - e.g. if width of `20px` is set, the content will take up `20px` and the padding/border/margin will be on top of that
- `border-box` is often preferred
  - takes into account content, border and padding in height/width (not margin)
